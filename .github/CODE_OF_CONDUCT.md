# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of the **Everywhere** project, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

As we transition to a professional operation model and adopt the **BSL 1.1 (Business Source License)**, we remain committed to fostering an open, welcoming, and sustainable ecosystem. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to a healthy, inclusive, and professionally respectful community.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behaviors

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* **Empathy and Kindness**: Demonstrating support for both new users and long-term contributors.
* **Professionalism regarding Project Changes**: Engaging in constructive and respectful dialogue regarding the project’s roadmap, licensing (BSL), and corporate transition.
* **Respecting Diverse Viewpoints**: Gracefully accepting differing opinions on technical implementation or community management.
* **Focusing on Community Health**: Prioritizing the long-term sustainability of the project, including the balance between personal free use and enterprise compliance.
* **Transparency**: Being honest about mistakes and taking responsibility for corrections.

### Unacceptable Behaviors

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* **Harassment and Discrimination**: Sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention.
* **License Misinformation**: Intentionally spreading false information regarding the BSL 1.1 terms or the software’s "free for personal use with own API key" status to cause fear or confusion.
* **Trolling and Personal Attacks**: Insulting, derogatory comments, or public/private harassment.
* **Privacy Violations**: Publishing others' private information (such as physical addresses, private emails, or private API keys) without explicit permission.
* **Malicious Disruption**: Intentional attempts to sabotage the project’s professional transition or reputation.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders (the **Sylinko** core team) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (GitHub, Discord, Telegram, etc.) and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces or at official events.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at: [contact@sylinko.com](mailto:contact@sylinko.com).

### Enforcement Guidelines

1. **Correction**: A private, written warning for unprofessional behavior or inappropriate language.
2. **Warning**: A formal warning for a single incident or a series of actions, which may include a temporary restriction on interaction with the community.
3. **Temporary Ban**: A temporary ban from all community spaces for a specified period due to serious or sustained violations.
4. **Permanent Ban**: A permanent ban for demonstrating a pattern of violation, including sustained harassment or malicious attempts to harm the project’s community and professional standing.

## A Note on Openness and Sustainability

The Everywhere project believes in the power of open code. While the **BSL 1.1** license supports our full-time development team, we affirm that **the core functionality of the software remains accessible to you**. Using your own API key to experience the software is, and will remain, a core part of our community's accessibility. We ask all members to respect this balance.
